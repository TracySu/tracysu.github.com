title: "One little happy thing"
---


We met around 7pm in an officer at Taksim square, Istanbul. Soon she found a seat next to me, and her yoga mat attracted my attention. I then asked if she's go camping. She said no, just do yoga anywhere. I pondered what a passion! 

Then we naturally started chatting. She's German, teaching in an international school in Switzerland now. Must has been travelling a lot, judged from her dress and knapsack, shabby but compact. 

As the conversation went deeper, we included topics other than our feelings about Istanbul and Turkey. "Do you like art?" She asked. This question turned me on as being a computer person, I can't say yes, because I knew nothing about music, I was afraid to talk about that to be fair, luckily we didn't cover that. I can't say no, because hardly no one hates it, doesn't it? Then I said, "Yeah, why not?" Shortly after, the shuttle came, we were transferred to the bus sation. On the shuttle, we did talk almost every second, from Laozi, Muslim, Buddhism, yoga, to vegetarianism, poem, literature, everything. 

The conversation was continuing as we were waiting the buses. We didn't want it comes to an end soon though the buses have been already delayed for more than half an hour. I complained how I was cheated yesterday, and then she opened a book of Rumi's poems, read to me, and comforted me. She is a veteran dieter as well as a good consoler. Money will come and go, however long I belived. I translated and read her my favorite poem as well, I called it ***If***. She liked my translation ***flowing cloud on hands*** in one case. Everyone else were just staring at the only two strange foreigners. But that was an awesome moment in life.

As a teacher, she displayed somewhat like what a teacher always does, I mean impose ideas a bit, even though how she wasn't willing to nor tried not to do so. But I didn't mind. In one time, There was a local man came to me, and tried to talk, she whispered in my ear, "He has not good energy." I asked, "How do you know?", She replied, "maybe feeling." She even predicted I will not change in 10 years as she knew me well, I would hope so but I don't know if this is good. But I have to admitted it, she was right, no one else has ever fathomed, this is ture for me! Magic! 

However, sadily, we had to go separte ways, she's going to Kony where Rumi, her favourite poet from, I was going to Cappadocia. I shall never forget her eyes when we about to say farewell. 

We were just like old bosom friends meet again, this is the happiest thing in travelling.
